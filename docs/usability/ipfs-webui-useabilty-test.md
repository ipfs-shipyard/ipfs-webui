# IPFS Web UI Usability Test

> Visit webui.ipfs.io and find the peer ID of your node

  - _Do they have a daemon running already?_
  - _Do they follow the prompts to start their daemon?_
  - _Do they have to go and download go-ipfs first?_

> Are you connected to the IPFS network? How many peers is your node connected to?

  - _Are they and do they say yes?_
  - _Do they find the peer count?_
  - _How do they feel about that?_

> Add a picture you'd like to share to your IPFS node
>
> Copy the share link and send it to me via email _(or whatever works best for you)_

  - _Do they figure out where the add files feature is?_
  - _Do they manage to upload the file?_
  - _Do they find and copy the share link?_
  - _Do they try drag-and-drop? or do they use the add button or..._
  - _Are you able to get the file from the Web UI at your end_

>   How long do you think that picture will still be available/at that address/at that link?

  - _Do they think they have saved it locally or uploaded to the cloud_
  - _If they answer so that it seems like they understand about the close-the-computer-its-unavailable thing, ask_:
    - How would you make sure that picture is always available?
    - Can anyone find that photo, or just me?


> I'll send you a share link. Download the file to your desktop

  - _Do they find the download link?_
  - _Do they get the file?_

> Add the file and and explore it the IPLD data behind it. What node type is it?

  - _Does the question make sense to them?_
  - _Do they say `protobuf`, or something else?_

> Explore the "Project Apollo Archives" IPLD dataset, follow the "albums" link, and find picture to view on the IPFS gateway

  - _Do they click through the album link?_
  - _Do they find a jpg?_
  - _Do they find the View on IPFS Gateway link?_

> Pick a dataset from https://archives.ipfs.io/ and explore it the IPLD structure behind it.

  - _Do they? ...this requires copy and pasting the cid from the website into the explore form_
